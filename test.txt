My name&#39;s Kayvon and though you wouldn’t know that I performed in the top 1% in math on the ACT, I’ve always performed consistently in the areas of math and logic my entire life. With anatural passion for learning, I’m now taking on the challenge of completing my Web Development Certification at Kable Academy in Cincinnati. In an effort to understand a variety of programming languages, I’ve studied graphic and user interface design, built Android apps, done Python scripting, and Unity game development. I believe that there aren’t really any limits to what I can accomplish when I apply myself. So, based upon the connections and business relationships that you have, I’d appreciate a recommendation of anyone or a specific company for me to reach out to on Linkedin for an introduction?
